The quickest way to shorten a URL:

{{{
as("bitlyapidemo", "R_0da49e0a9118ff35f52f629d2d71bf07").call(shorten("http://rosaloves.com/"));
}}}

Breaking it down, `as` is a factory method for a Shortener instance:

{{{
Shortener bitly = as("bitlyapidemo", "R_0da49e0a9118ff35f52f629d2d71bf07");
}}}

It's static so as to support a nice DSL-like interface. If you for some reason prefer verbosity, you can qualify it more fully:

{{{
Shortener bitly = Bitly.as("bitlyapidemo", "R_0da49e0a9118ff35f52f629d2d71bf07");
}}}

Once you have a shortener, you can call methods on it:

{{{
bitly.call(shorten("http://rosaloves.com/"));
}}}
